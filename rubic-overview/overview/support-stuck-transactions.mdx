title: "Stuck Transactions & Refund"
---

_When conducting cross-chain transactions on the Rubic platform, most are completed within 2–10 minutes (depending on the chosen networks and provider). However, due to the nature of such transactions, they may occasionally get stuck, requiring refunds from the provider._

## **Causes Of Stuck Cross-Chain Transactions**

There are several reasons why cross-chain transactions get stuck:

1. The transaction exceeds the deadline set by the provider (e.g., 90 minutes).
2. An incorrect wallet address is specified by the user for receiving funds in the target network.
3. The sent token or the token to be received is not supported by the provider.
4. Due to gas price changes during the exchange process, the paid amount of gas is not sufficient to cover the gas fee in the target network.
5. Token price changes during the transaction execution, causing the transaction to get stuck due to the set slippage.

## **Refund Options**

In these cases, the provider selected in the transaction processes the refund. Depending on the provider, refunds may occur in the following ways:

1. The user receives the originally sent token in the source network.
2. The user receives a pool token (e.g., USDC, USDT, WETH, ETH) in either the source or target network.

## **Refund Process**

In most cases, the refund process is automatic. However, for some providers, users may need to manually request the refund. If your transaction is stuck and you haven’t received a refund in either the source or target network, please contact our support team via official Support Communication channels below:
