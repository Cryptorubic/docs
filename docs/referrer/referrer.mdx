## Referrer

<Note>
The **referrer** is a unique identifier included in requests to the Rubic API that helps us track the origin of API calls.
</Note>

Please indicate the `referrer` parameter in each API request in accordance with your project's title. For example, your project is "ABC\_Swap", in this case, please pass `abc_swap` as a referrer.

This will help us identify that transactions are calculated and performed on your platform.
