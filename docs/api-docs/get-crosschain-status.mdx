## Check transaction status

You can easily check your transaction status. Just provider source transaction hash and you will see the status in destination chain, as well as a hash in destination blockchain in case of transaction success

```javascript
// Your source transaction hash
const srcTxHash = '0x6a851726e31e207dcea611424c194fb3ce132404598646b6903ee43fe8930e95';
const status = await axios.get(
    `https://api-v2.rubic.exchange/api/info/status?srcTxHash=${srcTxHash}`
);
```

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://api-v2.rubic.exchange/api/info/status?srcTxHash=0x6a851726e31e207dcea611424c194fb3ce132404598646b6903ee43fe8930e95' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "destinationTxHash": "0x5e8c67f32c11d5f5a44dd6e9a9f92bb5762ea0e41bda01c6a77228365b614e02",
  "destinationNetworkTitle": "POLYGON",
  "destinationNetworkChainId": 137
}
```
