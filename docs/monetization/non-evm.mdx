# Fee Sharing from non-EVM chains via ChangeNOW

>
>Fee sharing from non-EVM chains is currently available only via the ChangeNOW provider. Fees are shared for cross-chain swaps across all networks supported by ChangeNOW, including both EVM and non-EVM networks.


### How does fee sharing via ChangeNOW work?

Fee sharing for transactions performed via ChangeNOW consists of several **key steps**:

1. The integrator sends requests to the Rubic API, indicating their previously whitelisted `integratorAddress` and `referrer`.
2. Based on the provided address, Rubic identifies that the trade was executed through the corresponding integrator.
3. Users perform swaps on the integratorsâ€™ platforms and pay fees, which ChangeNOW credits to the Rubic address.
4. Rubic calculates the integratorâ€™s share based on internal swap statistics.
5. The commission is transferred manually once per month to the `integratorAddress`, based on the internal swap statistics.

>Fees for all networks are credited in the **Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain)** network, in **USDT**.

The percentage-based fee model is applied, where the total fee is 1%. **This fee is split equally**: 0.5% to Rubic and 0.5% to the integrator.

**Integrators** **do not need to pass non-EVM addresses** for transactions via ChangeNOW - fees are paid in USDT on BNB Chain, regardless of the source networks (Solana, Ton, Bitcoin, etc.).
