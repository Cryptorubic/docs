2. The fee model you would like to use: Percentage-based, Fixed Amount, or Mixed.

<Note>
  Please find a detailed description of each model [here](https://docs.rubic.finance/rubic-api/monetization-and-fees).

3. The fee value:

a) _amount in USD_ for the Fixed Amount model;\

с) _amount in USD_ and _percentage_ for the Mixed model.

After receiving the required details, we'll list your address(es) on our side, and it will be necessary to set it as the `integratorAddress` in the requests to the Rubic API.
