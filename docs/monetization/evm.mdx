To start the process of receiving commissions, please provide our [team](https://t.me/RubicPartnershipBot) with the following details:

1. An EVM address for fee sharing.

<Note>If you’d like to use various fee models, please provide different EVM wallets for each fee value.</Note>

2. The fee model you would like to use: Percentage-based, Fixed Amount, or Mixed.

<Note>Please find a detailed description of each model [here](https://docs.rubic.finance/rubic-api/monetization-and-fees).</Note>

3. The fee value:

a) *amount in USD* for the Fixed Amount model;  
b) *percentage* for the Percentage-Based model;  
с) *amount in USD* and *percentage* for the Mixed model.

After receiving the required details, we'll list your address(es) on our side, and it will be necessary to set it as the `integratorAddress` in the requests to the Rubic API.

<Warning>If the `integratorAddress` is not specified, the default fixed fee in native tokens will be deducted from each transaction.</Warning>
