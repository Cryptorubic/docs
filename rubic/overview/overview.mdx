## **Focusing on Chain Abstraction**

| **Chain Abstraction Principles** | **Rubic**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Asset Management Abstraction** | Rubic’s **Best Rate Finder App** now features **“All Chains”**, a powerful addition that enhances the chain abstraction experience, allowing users to **monitor all their tokens across multiple networks in one place**. Besides, this new category provides a seamless way to explore the **most popular tokens, top gainers & losers across all supported blockchains** in a single view. Furthermore, users can now easily locate a specific token on **every available chain**, simplifying cross-chain asset discovery and trading.       |
| **Transaction Abstraction**      | Thanks to Rubic’s smart routing feature, users can execute cross-chain token swaps in **a single multi-hop transactio**n – eliminating the hassle of manually navigating multiple DEXs and bridges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Token Bridge Abstraction**     | As the Best Rate Finder, Rubic aggregates 70+ blockchains and 360+ **DEXs, bridges, & intent-based protocols** enabling seamless cross-chain interactions. By integrating bridging and protocol actions into a single transaction, Rubic simplifies the process with automated relayers that execute user intents effortlessly. **Aggregated bridges, DEXs & intent-based protocols handle all the work for users**, whether it’s a [cross-chain or on-chain trade](https://rubic.exchange/blog/on-chain-vs-off-chain-transactions-in-crypto/). |
| **Multi-Chain Abstraction**      | On Rubic, users can seamlessly swap assets to, from, and across EVM, non-EVM, and Layer2 chains, all within a single interface. When swapping to non-EVM chains, for example, one doesn’t need to log in to a non-EVM wallet (like for Bitcoin, Ton, etc.) and simply enter the receiver’s wallet address on a non–EVM chain without needing to log in twice.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## **0% Protocol Fees**

Rubic now offers **zero fees** for swaps under \$100! Most on-chain swaps involving stablecoins or native tokens are also completely free.

Additionally, bridging **\$USDT** from popular EVM chains to **TRON** and all swaps with **Solana** are now entirely fee-free on Rubic.
