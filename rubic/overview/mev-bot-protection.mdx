Important to note, that it works only for swaps **on and from Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain & Polygon**.

### **This is how it works:**

1. Private Transaction Submission:

- Users submit private transactions on Rubic.

2. bloXroute Processing in BDN:

- bloXroute, within its Blockchain Distribution Network (BDN), processes private transactions.

3. Direct Routing:

- Private transactions are routed directly to specific destinations:
- Ethereum: Sent to the partner block builder.
- BSC: Sent to bloXroute’s block builder.
- Polygon: A just-in-time delivery mechanism is used to reduce the chance of frontrunning.

4. Avoiding Public Mempool (For Ethereum and BNB Chain):
