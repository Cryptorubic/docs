Rubic's 2025 roadmap focuses on chain abstraction, more chains and providers, and a smoother user experience. We're planning to introduce social login and gasless transactions, which removes the need for users to hold native tokens for fees. Enhanced swap tools, such as optimised slippage, dollar-based trades and better provider evaluation, aim to improve UX, routing and execution.

In 2025, Rubic is expanding its integrations and liquidity network. There will be a strong focus on wallets, DEXs, and aggregators to integrate the Rubic API and SDK. The platform will add support for new chains and liquidity sources.  Also, Rubic plans to introduce strategic partnerships with intent providers to launch highly expected chains from Day 1.

The second half of 2025 will bring more customization and simpler access. Developers and integrators will gain access to customizable dashboards, and expanded SDK support, and users will get a lite app version.
