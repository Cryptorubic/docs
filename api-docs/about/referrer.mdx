## Referrer

<Info>
  The **referrer** is a unique identifier included in requests to the Rubic API that helps us track the origin of API calls.
</Info>

Please indicate the `referrer` parameter in each API request in accordance with your project's title. For example, your project is "TestSwap", in this case, please pass `testswap` as a referrer.

This will help us identify that transactions are calculated and performed on your platform.

## Rate limits

| Rubic API endpoint types                                          | Endpoints           | Limits       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Standard Rubic API endpoint (no API key)                          | `api-v2`            | 10 RPM       |
| Rubic API endpoint with increased limits (an API key is required) | `pro-api-v2`        | 400 RPM      |
| Dedicated Rubic API domain (an API key is required)               | `integrator-api-v2` | Customizable |

If the rate limits of the standard Rubic API endpoint are not sufficient for your use case, access to **pro-api-v2** with extended limits can be provided. To obtain access to **pro-api-v2**, please contact our [Business Development team](https://t.me/RubicPartnership) to discuss the details and receive an API key.

The API key for **pro-api-v2** (as well as for a dedicated subdomain, if applicable) should be passed via request headers:

```javascript
headers={
    "apikey": "your_api_key"
}
```
