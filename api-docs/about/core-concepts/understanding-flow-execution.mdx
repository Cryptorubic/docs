Rubic does not split swaps into multiple exec

### **1) EVM (decentralized)**

**Description**

Decentralized EVM routes are executed via a smart contract call.

**Returned data**

- to — contract address
- data — encoded contract call
- value — native value attached to the transaction

**Client behavior**

- Send an EVM transaction using to, data, and value
- Track the transaction until completion

### **2) EVM (deposit)**

**Description**

Deposit-based EVM routes are executed by transferring funds to a deposit address on an EVM chain.

**Returned data**

- to — token contract address (or deposit address for native token swap)
- data — encoded transfer (or 0x for native token swap)
- value — 0 (or transfer amount for native token swap)

**Client behavior**

- Send an EVM transaction transferring value to to with the provided data
- Track execution using the provided identifiers

### **3) non-EVM (decentralized)**

**Description**

Decentralized non-EVM routes are executed using a **native transaction format** specific to the target blockchain.

**Returned data**

- a blockchain-specific transaction object

**Supported networks**

- TON
- Tron
- Solana
- Sui

**Client behavior**

- Sign and send the returned transaction using the native wallet / SDK of the corresponding blockchain
- Track the transaction until completion

### **4) non-EVM (deposit)**

**Description**

Deposit-based non-EVM routes are executed via a **manual deposit transfer**.

**Returned data**

- depositAddress
- amountToSend

**Client behavior**

- Transfer amountToSend to depositAddress from the user wallet
- Track execution using the provided identifiers

## **Summary**

| **Execution type**      | **User action**               |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| EVM (decentralized)     | Contract call                 |
| EVM (deposit)           | Transfer to deposit address   |
| non-EVM (decentralized) | Native blockchain transaction |
| non-EVM (deposit)       | Manual deposit transfer       |
