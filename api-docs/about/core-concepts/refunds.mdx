title: "Refunds"
description: "Refund handling depends on the selected provider.

In most cases, refunds are processed automatically by the provider and do not require any action from the client or the user."

### **Automatic refunds**

For the majority of providers:

- refunds are triggered automatically
- no additional API calls are required
- the client only needs to track the transaction status until it is resolved

### **Manual refunds (Celer)**

For **Celer-based routes**, refunds require an explicit action.

Rubic provides a [dedicated refund endpoint](https://docs.relay.link) that returns the transaction data required to execute a refund on-chain.



**Available options**

- Use the dedicated **Celer refund endpoint** described in this documentation
- Contact **Rubic support** if manual assistance is required

### **Notes**

- Refund availability and execution logic are **provider-specific**
- Not all routes support manual refunds
- If a refund endpoint is not available for a provider, refunds are handled automatically or via support
