<Tip>
  Fee sharing from non-EVM chains is currently available via ChangeNOW, Changelly, Exolix and Near Intents. Fees are shared for cross-chain transactions across all networks supported by these providers, including both EVM and non-EVM networks.

### **How does fee sharing via deposit-based providers work?**

Fee sharing for transactions performed via deposit-based providers consists of several **key steps**:

1. The integrator sends requests to the Rubic API, indicating their previously whitelisted EVM `integratorAddress` and `referrer`.
2. Based on the provided address, Rubic identifies that the trade was executed through the corresponding integrator.
3. Users perform transactions on the integrators’ platforms and pay fees, which providers credit to the Rubic address. Only the percentage-based fee model is applied.
4. Rubic calculates the integrator’s share based on internal swap statistics.
5. The commission is transferred manually once per month to the `integratorAddress`, based on the internal swap statistics.

## 💡 FAQ

1. **In which network are commissions credited?**

Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain) or Ethereum.

2. **In which token are commissions credited?**

USDT token.

3. **What’s the size of the commission?**

The total commission for transactions via deposit-based providers  is 1%, shared equally between Rubic (0.5%) and an integrator (0.5%). The total fee value can be changed upon request.

4. **How often do integrators receive commissions for transactions via ChangeNOW?**

Once a month, the fees are transferred to the whitelisted `integratorAddress`. For address listing, please contact our [Business Development team](https://t.me/RubicPartnership).

5. **Do integrators need to indicate non-EVM addresses in the integratorAddress field for transactions from non-EVM networks?**

No – commissions are always paid in USDT on BNB Chain or Ethereum, so non-EVM addresses are not required.

6. **What if we have multiple addresses for collecting commissions? Which address will be used for fee sharing?**

In this case, you need to inform the Rubic team which listed address should be used to receive commissions for transactions processed via deposit-based providers.

7. **Should integrators continue passing the whitelisted EVM address even for transactions from non-EVM chains?**

Yes - the listed  EVM wallet address is used by Rubic to link swaps to the integrator. This address should be passed consistently across all chains in the `integratorAddress` field.

In addition, including the `referrer` parameter in API requests is required to properly track the origin of each transaction.
