title: "Swagger & OpenAPI"
description: "Rubic API provides an interactive Swagger UI generated from its OpenAPI specification.
Swagger is intended to help integrators explore available endpoints, inspect request and response schemas, and test API calls."

## **Swagger UI**

The Swagger UI is available at:

https://api-v2.rubic.exchange/api/swagger/

It always reflects the **current state of the API** and is generated directly from the OpenAPI specification.

## **OpenAPI specification**

Rubic API is described using **OpenAPI 3.x**.

The specification defines:

- available endpoints and HTTP methods
- request parameters and request bodies
- response schemas
- error response formats

Swagger UI is a visual representation of this specification.

## **Raw OpenAPI files**

In addition to Swagger UI, Rubic provides direct access to the raw OpenAPI specification files.

These files can be used for:

- generating API clients
- importing into tools like Postman or Insomnia
- validating requests and responses
- offline inspection of the API schema

Available formats:

- JSON:

  https://api-v2.rubic.exchange/api/routes/swagger-json
- YAML:

  https://api-v2.rubic.exchange/api/routes/swagger-yaml

## **What Swagger is useful for**

Swagger is best suited for:

- discovering available endpoints
- understanding request and response structures
- checking required and optional fields
- testing API calls in an isolated environment

It is especially useful during early integration and debugging.

## **Using Swagger for testing**

You can execute requests directly from Swagger UI.

Typical flow:

1. Open the Swagger UI
2. Select an endpoint
3. Click **Try it out**
4. Fill in the required parameters
5. Execute the request
6. Inspect the response

Responses returned by Swagger are identical to real API responses.

## **Versioning and updates**

The Swagger UI and OpenAPI files always represent the **latest version** of the API.

As the API evolves:

- new fields or endpoints may be added
- existing fields may become deprecated

Integrators should follow the documentation and changelog when updating integrations.
